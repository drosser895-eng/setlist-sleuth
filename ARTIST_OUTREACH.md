## 📋 Outreach Strategy & Best Practices
1. **Highlight the "Soul Mirror"**: Tell artists we analyze their "Creative DNA" to match them with the right fans.
2. **Focus on Ownership**: Remind them they own 100% of the IP generated in the Fire Studio.
3. **The "Skill" Angle**: Explain that their music isn't just background noise—it's the core of a high-stakes competitive arena.
