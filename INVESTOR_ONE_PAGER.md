# 📊 Investor One-Pager: Blaze Mix Master (The New Music Economy)

**Executive Summary**: Blaze Mix Master is a unified AI ecosystem that combines a high-stakes rhythm game, a decentralized social video platform (Blaze TV), and a conversational DAW (Fire Studio). We are disrupting the $26B music streaming industry by giving 100% of creator revenue back to the artists.

## ⚡ The Problem
Artists lose up to 70% of their revenue to streaming platforms and labels. Fans are passive consumers with no "skin in the game."

## 🔥 The Solution
1. **0% Artist Tax**: 100% of tips and sales go to creators.
2. **Skill-Based Monetization**: Revenue is generated via competitive gaming fees (anchored by Antigravity Attestation) and high-value ads.
3. **Generative Assets**: Fans turn music into interactive gaming experiences via AI, creating new utilities for audio IP.
