Hi [Artist Name],

We're scouting underground talent for the Blaze Mix Master pilot launch. We've built an artist-first platform where fans tip you directly via your own payment links—we don't take a cut.

We'd love to feature your track [Track Name] in our 48-hour 'Battle Zone' event starting [Date].

**Next Steps:**
1. Reply with your preferred track link.
2. Send your PayPal.me or Ko-fi URL.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,
David Rosser
Founder, Blaze Mix Master
