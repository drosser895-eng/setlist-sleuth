# Blaze Mix Master — Audit & Regulator Pack (Executive Technical Brief)

## Purpose
This pack provides a compact, evidence-oriented technical brief for legal counsel and regulators that demonstrates the platform is deterministic, auditable, and skill-based (not chance).

## ⚖️ Skill-Based Determinism
Unlike gambling platforms where "Edge" is calculated by chance, Blaze Mix Master's "Edge" is defined by user performance:
- **Zero-RNG Core**: Game outcomes are determined solely by the user's interaction with the AI Music Engine.
- **Auditable Performance**: Every session generates a Merkle root representing the exact user inputs and score metrics.
- **Tamper-Proof Anchoring**: Scores are anchored to the `AnchorRegistry` contract, creating an immutable history of wins.

## 🛡️ Anti-Fraud Multi-Layer Audit
1. **Catbot Auditor**: Real-time AI analysis for bot detection and "participation farming."
2. **Cryptographic Proofs**: Each high-stakes game is attestated via the Antigravity API.
3. **Transparency**: Users can verify their own score hash against the on-chain anchor via the Verifier UI.
